How about using AI in the next tool. The only thing that bothers me is AI technlogy is being run by giant companies and I am not sure how much of user's privacy will be protected!

In data analysis, cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors defined in an inner product space. Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between the vectors; that is, it is the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths.

However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do you if you do not act on upon them?

How about a tracker that can open up all your files and folders which you had been using before shutting down you PC?
It might help.
Feature:
- keep the history of what was opened.
- On starting the pc the app should start as well (this might be a little difficult to achieve in MacOS)
- Give two options to open up the entire history before last shutdown or selected files/folders
